# User Story 
   As a student
    I WANT a HTML file that meets the requirements of the module 1 criteria 
    SO THAT I develop a better understanding of the format and structure of an HTML page 

# Acceptance Criteria 

    

# Procedures 

    # 1 First thing I did was change all the div elements in the HTML into semantic HTML elements 

    # 2 Second thing I did was try to make sure the semantic elements I picked followed a logical structure. 
        For example, the first element I changed in the body was to a header. Then, I changed the middle 
        section to contain a section element tag. The last part of the website was changed to a footer which 
        is typically located at the bottom. 

    # 3 Third thing I did is provide alt tags to the image elements. I was debating putting an alternative image, 
        but ended up just providing a very small and breif description of the image 

    # 4 Lastly, I created a concise, description title in the head element
